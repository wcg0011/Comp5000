for the newest version of TheHub.sql, at the bottom are some "ALTER" commands that will update your database to be in line with mine.
if you want to create a whole new database, just run the code after deleting the last six lines, and it should give you the same thing as the "ALTER" commands.

the folder i've uploaded has a good portion of the todo list functionality as well as basic login stuff. 
a list of what i've completed can be found in the comments of index.jsp at the top.

all the files i've just uploaded at 12:25pm are in a second branch called todo v0.1

don't forget, for all the files that access the sql database, you'll need to change the address/password to fit your own stuff
